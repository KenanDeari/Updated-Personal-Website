              <p>
                Kenan Deari grew up the youngest of two children. Being in a
                family of first-generation immigrants in America that moved from
                Bosnia to Dallas in 1998, I didn't know what to expect. The
                struggles of fitting in, learning to speak & write English were
                difficult but helped craft me in the man I'm today. It wasn't
                long before he made friends with almost anyone he interacted
                with due to his confident, friendly, and funny personality.
                Kenan was always involved in sports, he played soccer,
                basketball, and football till graduation & had teams outside of
                school.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kenan spent his childhood growing up in Plano, Texas. He was
                enrolled in Plano ISD schools from K-12. Kenan graduated from
                Plano Senior High School ahead of schedule for the class of
                2017. After graduation, he assisted and helped run a
                family-owned corner store and also worked for a friends
                business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kenan is currently employed for Crest Cadillac in Frisco, Texas.
                His role is the Loan Car Manager. His title consists of
                maintaining a fleet of Cadillac vehicles, dispatch drivers &
                ensure vehicles are ready for scheduled valets on weekdays (6-8
                per day), manage & schedule 10 employees, and ensure exceptional
                service for all our guests. One of the most significant
                implications Kenan provided for Crest Cadillac was the
                deployment and understanding of a new software to assist
                correctly calculating toll-roads and fuel charges that customers
                had due. The change Kenan provided helped solve an on-going
                issue the service department faced.
              </p>
              <p>
                Because of his desire to understand and become a successful web
                developer, Kenan enrolled himself in the Full Stack Web
                Development program offered by Southern Methodist University.
                Kenan will come out of the program with strong skills in HTML,
                CSS, JavaScript. He will also be equipped with experience
                working with Bootstrap, React.js, Node.js, MySQL, and much more.
                Kenan's a firm believer that you can never learn enough. He's
                extremely dedicated, passionate, and detailed in his work. He
                never settles & always strives to grow.
              </p>
              <p>
                Following Kenan's graduation, he will be seeking a role for an
                entry or junior level front end development, back-end
                development, or JavaScript development roles. The experience &
                skills learned in SMU's Full-Stack program have prepared Kenan
                to prosper in any environment. Paired with the personal drive,
                mindset, and resilience that Kenan possesses, he believes the
                sky is the limit.
