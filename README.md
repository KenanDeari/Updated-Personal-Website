# My-Website

On this project, I created my website using HTML, CSS, and the benefits of Bootstrap.  Throughout the webpage, you will see implementations of semantic HTML, containers, grids, rows, and columns. The presence of the bootstrap provides content organization & allows for mobile responsiveness. Semantic guidelines were applied to simplify the code & create it more accessible. I also resorted to using FormSpree to link any submisson of the "Contact Me" form to my inbox. I enjoyed the time I spent working on this project and will constantly add new features & update content as needed. The overall task pushed me to learn more and kept me motivated.
